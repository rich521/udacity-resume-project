# udacity-resume-project

Using jQuery, developed an interactive resume application that reads all data from a JSON file and then dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information. Further customized the project by personalizing the design using CSS.

**'resumeBuilder.js'** - Add or edit json data in resumeBuilder.js

**'down.js'** - simple slide down & slide up jQuery function for different sections of the resume
